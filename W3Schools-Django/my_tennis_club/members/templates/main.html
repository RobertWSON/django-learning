        <h3>Initial Django Setup</h3>

        <p>Originally when this Django App was setup, a members view was created for displaying 
           a hello world page and also <br> a template was used with a members view for displaying a page with
           Hello World Heading and first Django Project Welcome Message. <br>
        </p>   
        <p>This was all displayed on members/ route, but because members/ route is now used for getting details 
           of people from a database, <br> it is better to have separate routes to keep these initial 
           Django setup pages.
        </p>
        <p>I have given a link here, to access <a href="hello/">Hello World Page</a></p>
        {#<p>and I have a link here, to access <a href="first/">First Django Project Page</a></p> #}
        <p>and I have a link here, to access <a href="first_django_page/">First Django Project Page</a></p>

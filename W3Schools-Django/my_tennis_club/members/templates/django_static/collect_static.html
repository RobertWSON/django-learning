      <h3>Handle Static Files</h3>

      <p>Static files in your project, like stylesheets, JavaScripts and images are not handled automatically by Django<br> 
         when <code>DEBUG = False</code>.<br><br>
         When <code>DEBUG = True</code>, this worked fine, all we had to do was to put them in a <code>static</code>
         folder of members application.<br><br>
         When <code>DEBUG = False</code>, static files have to be collected and put in a specified folder before we can 
         use it.
      </p>

      <h3 id="collect_static">Collect Static Files</h3>

      <p>To collect all necessary static files for your Django project, start by specifying a <code>STATIC_ROOT</code>
         property in <code>settings.py</code>.<br><br>
         This specifies a folder where you want to collect your static files.<br><br>
         We will called this folder <code>productionfiles</code>, as it is a suitable name for what we are doing :<br><br>
         
         <code>my_tennis_club/my_tennis_club/settings.py</code> :
      </p>

      <img src="{% static 'images/django_static/collect/settings_static_root.png' %}"> 

      <p>You could manually create this folder and collect and put all static files of your Django project into this
         folder.<br> Django has a command that can do this for you:</br></br>
         On Mac this this is <code>python manage.py collectstatic</code></br> 
         and on Windows or Linux this is <code>py manage.py collectstatic</code>
      </p>

      <img src="{% static 'images/django_static/collect/collect_static.png' %}"> 

      <p>This collectstatic command will produce this result:</p>

      <img src="{% static 'images/django_static/collect/collect_static_result.png' %}"> 

      <p>311 files ? Why so many ? Well this is because of files stored with admin user interface, that come built-in with 
         Django<br> and also because of my own images to produce this website.</br></br>
         We want to keep this admin user interface feature in production, as it comes with a whole bunch of files including<br>
         stylesheets, fonts, images and JavaScripts. 
      </p>

      <h4 id="static_works">CSS Example Should Work Now</h4>

      <p>Now that you have collected static files of you project and <a href="/django_static/whitenoise">installed whitenoise</a>
         , your first CSS example from <a href="/django_static/files">Add Static File page</a><br> will finally work. <br><br>
         If your localhost server is not running, start it up again with your command line by typing this command below:
      </p>

      <img src="{% static 'images/django_static/collect/run_localhost_server_first_static_css.png' %}">  

      <p>And check out result in your own browser: <a href="/django_static/files/first_css_example">
         127.0.0.1:8000/django_static/files/first_css_example</a>.
      </p>

      <img src="{% static 'images/django_static/collect/first_css_now_works.png' %}"> 

      <p>This is same code below, from before on <a href="/django_static/files#mod_template">Add Static File page</a> 
         , that now works and shows CSS. 
      </p>

      <img src="{% static 'images/django_static/add_files/first_css_example_html_code.png' %}"> 

      <p>Next we will look at <a href="/django_static/global">Global Static Files</a></p>

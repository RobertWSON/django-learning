<p>{{ 7.1|floatformat:-2 }}</p>
<p>{{ 7|floatformat:-2 }}</p>


<p>As you can see from this floatformat example, we are using a django command to round each of 3 numbers 
    above with 2 negative decimal places. 7.122489 and 7.1 are floating point numbers that get rounded and 
    7 is an integer that does not get rounded because it does not have any decimal places.</p>

    <p>Get all records where firstname starts with letter "s":</p>    

    {# Istartswith Example starts here #}
    <p>The queryset object:</p>

    {{ mymembers }}

    <p>Loop through the items:</p>

    <table border='1'>
        <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
            <th>Firstname</th>
            <th>Lastname</th>

            <td>{{ x.id }}</td>
            <td>{{ x.firstname }}</td>
            <td>{{ x.lastname }}</td>

    <p>Here we have mymembers variable, which is an object and we are using this with a name of mydata outside of 
       context.<br>
       After defining our view, we are using mydata to access Member table to get all objects (records).<br>
       For all records we are getting all values for firstname field and then using a startswith filter to show all 
       records that have a firstname field starting with s .
     </p>

    {# Image showing HTML Template code, so we can see how data is used for this istartswith example #}
    {# <img src="{% static 'images/django_refs/field/.png' %}"> #}

    <p>In HTML Template we are using a for loop with mymembers object from views.py file.<br>
       After using istartswith filter in views.py, we are just showing all field name values for a record or records 
       that have a firstname starting with s or S.<br>
       We are using mymembers surrounded by double curly braces to show a queryset on page with details on that 
       filtered record.<br> 
       You will notice in queryset that joined_date field uses a datetime function to show date that member joined 
       tennis club.

    <h3>Definition and Usage</h3>

    <p>The <code>istartswith</code> lookup is used to get records that start with a specified value.<br><br>
       The <code>istartswith</code> lookup is case insensitive, so this means that it does not matter if a name
       starts with a lower case or upper case letter.<br><br>
       For a case sensitive search, use <a href="/field/startswith">startswith</a> lookup.
    </p>

    <h3>SQL Equivalent</h3>

    <p>The SQL equivalent to the example above will be:<br><br>
       
       <code>WHERE firstname LIKE 's%';</code>
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Syntax</h3>

    <p>All Field lookup keywords must be specified with fieldname, followed by two underscore characters 
       <code>__</code> and a keyword:<br><br>
       
       fieldname__istartswith='value'
    </p>

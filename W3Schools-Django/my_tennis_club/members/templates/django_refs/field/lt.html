    <h3>Less Than Example</h3>

    <p>Get all records where id is less than 3:</p>    

    {# Less than (lt) Example ends here #}
    <p>The queryset object:</p>

    {{ mymembers }}

    <p>Loop through the items:</p>

    <table border='1'>
        <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
            <th>Firstname</th>
            <th>Lastname</th>
        </tr>
        {% for x in mymembers %}
        <tr>
            <td>{{ x.id }}</td>
            <td>{{ x.firstname }}</td>
            <td>{{ x.lastname }}</td>
        </tr>
        {% endfor %}

    <p>Here we have mymembers variable, which is an object and we are using this with a name of mydata, outside of 
       context.<br>
       After defining our view, we are using mydata to access Member table to get all objects (records).<br>
       For all records, we are getting all values for fields and using a less than (lt) filter to show 
       only records that have an id of less than 3.<br>  
    </p>

    {# Image showing HTML Template code, so we can see how data is used for this less then (lt) example #}
    {# <img src="{% static 'images/django_refs/field/.png' %}"> #} 

    <p>In HTML Template we are using a for loop with mymembers object from views.py file.<br> 
       After using lt filter in views.py, we are showing all field values that we want, for records 
       with an id of 1 and 2.<br>
       We are using mymembers, surrounded by double curly braces, to show a queryset on page with details of 
       those filtered records.<br>  
       You will notice in queryset, that joined_date field uses a datetime function to show date that a member 
       joined tennis club.

    <h3>Definition and Usage</h3>

    <p>The <code>lt</code> lookup is used to get records that are less than a specified value.<br><br>
       For a less than or equal to search, use <a href="/field/lt">lte</a> lookup.
    </p>

    <h3>SQL Equivalent</h3>

    <p>The SQL equivalent to the example above will be:<br><br>
       
       <code>WHERE id < 3;</code>
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Syntax</h3>

    <p>All Field lookup keywords must be specified with fieldname, followed by two underscore characters 
       <code>__</code> and a keyword:<br><br>

       fieldname__lt=value
    </p>

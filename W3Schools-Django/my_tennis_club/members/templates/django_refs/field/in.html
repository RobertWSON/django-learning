    <h3>In Example</h3>

    <p>Get all records where firstname is one of values in a list:</p> 

    {# In filter Example starts here #}
    <p>The queryset object:</p>

    {{ mymembers }}

    <p>Loop through the items:</p>

    <table border='1'>
        <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
            <th>Firstname</th>
            <th>Lastname</th>
        </tr>
        {% for x in mymembers %}
        <tr>
            <td>{{ x.id }}</td>
            <td>{{ x.firstname }}</td>
            <td>{{ x.lastname }}</td>
        </tr>
        {% endfor %}
    </table>
    {# In filter Example ends here #}

    <p>Here we have mymembers variable, which is an object and we are using this with a name of mydata, outside of 
       context.<br>
       After defining our view, we are using mydata to access Member table to get all objects (records).<br>
       For all records, we are getting all values for fields and using an in filter to show only records that have 
       a matching<br> firstname field value, from a list.
    </p>

    {# Image showing HTML Template code, so we can see how data is used for this in example #}
    {# <img src="{% static 'images/django_refs/field/.png' %}"> #}    

    <p>In HTML Template we are using a for loop with mymembers object from views.py file.<br> 
       After using in filter within views.py, we are showing field values that we want, for records with a 
       firstname field that matches our in filter.<br>
       We are using mymembers, surrounded by double curly braces, to show a queryset on page with details of 
       those filtered records.<br>  
       You will notice in queryset, that joined_date field uses a datetime function to show date that a member 
       joined tennis club.

    <h3>Definition and Usage</h3>

    <p>The <code>in</code> lookup is used to get records, where a value is one of values in an iterable.<br> 
       An iterable can be a list, tuple, string or queryset.<br><br>
       The <code>in</code> lookup is case sensitive.
    </p>

    <h3>SQL Equivalent</h3>

    <p>The SQL equivalent to the example above will be:<br><br>

       <code>WHERE firstname IN ('Tobias', 'Linus', 'John');</code>
    </p>
    
    <hr>

    <h3>Syntax</h3>

    <p>All Field lookup keywords must be specified with fieldname, followed by two underscore characters 
       <code>__</code> and a keyword:<br><br>
       
       fieldname__in=[value1, value2, value3, ...]
    </p>

    <h3>Icontains Example</h3>

    <p>Do a case insensitive search for all records that have value "ref" in lastname column:</p>

    {# Icontains Example starts here #}
    <p>The queryset object:</p>

    {{ mymembers }}

    <p>Loop through the items:</p>

    <table border='1'>
        <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
            <th>Firstname</th>
            <th>Lastname</th>
        </tr>
        {% for x in mymembers %}
        <tr>
            <td>{{ x.id }}</td>
            <td>{{ x.firstname }}</td>
            <td>{{ x.lastname }}</td>
        </tr>
        {% endfor %}
    </table>

    <p>Here we have mymembers variable, which is an object and we are using this with a name of mydata, outside of 
       context.<br>
       After defining our view, we are using mydata to access Member table to get all objects (records).<br>
       For all records, we are getting all values for fields and using an icontains filter to show records that
       have a firstname field value containing ref.
    </p> 

    {# Image showing HTML Template code, so we can see how data is used for this icontains example #}
    {# <img src="{% static 'images/django_refs/field/.png' %}"> #}    

    <p>In HTML Template we are using a for loop with mymembers object from views.py file.<br>
        After using icontains filter in views.py, we are showing field name values we want for records that
        have a firstname containing ref.<br>
        We are using mymembers, surrounded by double curly braces, to show a queryset on page with details of 
        our filtered record.<br>  
        You will notice in queryset, that joined_date field uses a datetime function to show date that a member 
        joined tennis club.

       The <code>icontains</code> lookup is case insensitive.</p>
       For a case insensitive search, use the <a href="/field/contains">contains</a> lookup.</p>

    <h3>SQL Equivalent</h3>

    <p>The SQL equivalent to the example above will be:<br><br>
       
       <code>WHERE lastname LIKE '%ref%';</code>
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Syntax</h3>

    <p>All Field lookup keywords must be specified with fieldname, followed by two underscore characters 
       <code>__</code> and a keyword:<br><br>
       
       fieldname__icontains='value'
    </p>

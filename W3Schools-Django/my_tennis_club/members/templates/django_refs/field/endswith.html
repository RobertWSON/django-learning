    <p>Get all records where firstname ends with letter "s":</p>

    <p>The queryset object:</p>

    {{ mymembers }}

    <p>Loop through the items:</p>

    <p>Here we have mymembers variable, which is an object and we are using this with a name of mydata, outside of 
       context.<br>
       After defining our view, we are using mydata to access Member table to get all objects (records).<br>
       For all records, we are getting all values for fields and using an endswith filter to show records that
       have a firstname field value ending with s.
    </p>

    {# <img src="{% static 'images/django_refs/field/.png' %}"> #}

    <p>In HTML Template we are using a for loop with mymembers object from views.py file.<br>
       After using endswith filter in views.py, we are showing field name values we want for records that
       have a firstname ending with s.<br>
       Using mymembers surrounded by double curly braces, shows a queryset on page with details on that filtered
       record (including date member joined tennis club).<br><br><br> 
       
       We are using mymembers, surrounded by double curly braces, to show a queryset on page with details of 
       our filtered record.<br>  
       You will notice in queryset, that joined_date field uses a datetime function to show date that a member 
       joined tennis club.

    <h3>Definition and Usage</h3>

    <p>The <code>endswith</code> lookup is used to get records that end with a specified value.<br><br>
       The <code>endswith</code> lookup is case sensitive, so this means that if a filter specifies lower case, 
       then it will only show a lower case letter.<br><br>
       For a case insensitive search, use <a href="/field/iendswith">iendswith</a> lookup.
    </p>

    <h3>SQL Equivalent</h3>

    <p>The SQL equivalent to the example above will be:<br><br>

       <code>WHERE firstname LIKE '%s%';</code>
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Syntax</h3>

    <p>All Field lookup keywords must be specified with fieldname, followed by two underscore characters 
       <code>__</code> and a keyword:<br><br>
       
       fieldname__endswith='value'
    </p>

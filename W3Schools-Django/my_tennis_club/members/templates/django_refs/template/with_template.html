    <h3>With for a variable in a template Example</h3>

    <p>Create a variable in a template and use it:<p>

    {# {% include "django_refs/template/with_example1.html"%} #} 
    {# I have found that we cannot use include for this example and it is better to use one view with #}
    
    {% with firstname="Stalikken" %}
      <h1>Hello{{ firstname }}</h1>
    {% endwith %}

    {# Image showing code in HTML Template file for this example #}  

    {# Explain Django code in HTML file #}
    <p>You can see, instead of using firstname variable from views.py, we are actually using firstname variable
       within this HTML templates.
    </p>

    <h3>Definition and Usage</h3>

    <p>The <code>with</code> tag is used to create variables in Django templates.</p>

    <p>This can be useful when you need to ask for same variable many times, like in a loop.</p>

    <h4>With in a For Loop Example</h4>

    <p>Use <code>with</code> tag to get length of <code>fruits</code> only one time:</p>

    {# {% include "django_refs/template/with_example2.html" %} #}
    {# I have found that we cannot use include for this example and it is better to use one view with #}
    {# Django code in this HTML Template File. #}
    {% with var=fruits|length %}
      {% for x in fruits %}
        <p>{{ x }} is one of {{ var }} fruits.</p>
      {% endfor %}
    {% endwith %}

    {# Show image of views.py file #}

    {# Explain code in views.py file #}
    <p>Check out views.py to see what fruits list looks like.<br>
      You can see that within our context we are using an array with a list of fruit items.<br><br> 

      <b>Note:</b> Our object <code>fruits</code> here holds an array which holds all fruit items.<br>
       <br>

      If you want to have this example within a web page that you are creating like I have, then within context, 
      you can have <br>fruits object pickup a fruits array. Outside context you can show the array with its item 
      names.<br>
      With this newer return method we are are using render to pickup request, template and context. 
    </p>

    {# Show image of Django code in HTML file #}

    {# Explain Django code in HTML file #}
    <p>In HTML Template, first line of code is creating a variable var for an object and naming it fruits. <br>
       A length filter is then used for number of items within this object, which is 4.<br>
       Next we are using a for loop for fruits variable (object), where x represents an item in this object.<br>
       A looped Paragraph tag is used to show each item name using x and it shows var (total number of items in 
       fruits array)<br> using a length filter for array length.<br>
    </p>

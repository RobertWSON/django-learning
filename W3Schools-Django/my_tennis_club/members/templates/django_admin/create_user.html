    <h2>Create Django Admin User</h2>

    <p>To be able to log into Django Admin Application, we need to create a user.<br><br>
       This is done by typing this command on command line.<br><br>

       <b>Windows:</b>
    </p>

    {# Image showing how to create a new Django Admin User using Windows #}
    <img src="{% static 'images/django_admin/create_user/create_django_admin_user_using_windows.png' %}"> 

    <p><b>Mac/ Unix:</b></p>

    {# Image showing how to create a new Django Admin User using Mac or Unix #}
    <img src="{% static 'images/django_admin/create_user/Create Django Admin User - Mac.png.png' %}"> 

    <p>This will give you a username prompt :</p>

    {# Image showing username prompt for creating a user with Django Admin #}
    <img src="{% static 'images/django_admin/create_user/Username Prompt.png' %}"> 

    <p>Here you must enter: username, e-mail address and password :</p>

    {# Image showing username created successfully #}
    <img src="{% static 'images/django_admin/create_user/Create Myself as a User.png' %}"> 

    <p>You should see that user is created with <code>Superuser created successfully</code> .</p>

    <p>To enter Django Admin user interface, start Django built-in local host server, by typing following 
        command shown below. 
    </p>
 
    {# Image showing command to run django built-in local host server after Django Admin user created #}

    <p>In browser window, click or type <a href="/admin">127.0.0.1:8000/admin</a> in web address bar and you 
       should get a result like this:<br><br>
       Fill in form with your correct username and password :
    </p>

    {# Image showing that you now have a username and password login #}
    <img src="{% static 'images/django_admin/create_user/Login Django Admin as a User.png' %}">  

    <p>In Django Admin you can now see users and groups</p>

    {# Image showing that you now have users and group, but a missing Model #}
    <img src="{% static 'images/django_admin/create_user/Logged into Django Admin.png' %}">  

    <p>In Django Admin we can create, read, update and delete groups and users, but where is Members model ?
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="model_missing">Missing Django Model</h2>

    <p>We have logged into Django Admin with a user name, but now we have a missing Members model.<br><br>
       There is nothing wrong with Members model missing at this stage, because we have to tell Django which
       models should show in Django admin interface.<br><br>
       We will learn next how to <a href="/django_admin/include_models">include Members model</a> in our 
       Django Admin.
